# Book Management Application

This is a full-stack Book Management app with a React frontend and Node.js backend.  
You can add, update, delete, view books, and import books in bulk from a CSV file.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v12 or higher)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

---

## Backend Setup and Run

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd book-management-app/backend
````

3. Initialize npm and install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install express cors multer csv-parser uuid
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. You should see:

   ```
   Server running on port 5000
   ```

Backend API is now running at: `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Frontend Setup and Run

1. Open the folder `book-management-app/frontend`.

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser by double-clicking or dragging it into a browser window.

   * Alternatively, you can serve it using VS Code Live Server or any local HTTP server for better experience.

3. The frontend will communicate with the backend API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Using the Application

* Add Book: Fill the Title, Author, and Published Year fields, then click Add Book.

* Update Book: Click the Edit button next to a book to load its data into the form, edit it, then click Update Book.

* Delete Book: Click the Delete button next to a book.

* Import CSV: Use the Choose File button to select the included `sample-books.csv` or your own CSV file, then click Import CSV.


## Sample CSV Format

Your CSV must have headers: `title,author,publishedYear`

Example:

  ]
}


## Troubleshooting

* Make sure backend is running before opening the frontend.
* Backend server must be at `http://localhost:5000`.
* Allow CORS if you run backend on a different port.
* Use latest browsers for best compatibility.
